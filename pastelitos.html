    <h5>Pastelitos Salvadoreños (Salvadoran Empanadas) served with curtido (pickled cabbage)</h5>
    <p>
      These crispy and delectable pastelitos de carne, or Salvadoran empanadas, are filled with minced meat and vegetables. In El Salvador they are served as an afternoon snack, but they also make great appetizers for parties. To save time, cook the fillings and assemble the empanadas the day before. You can refrigerate them overnight in a covered container before frying them.

        <li>1 Tsp chicken bouillon</li>
        <li>1 Tsp Annato seeds ground</li>
        <li>1/2 Tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 Cups vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Meat and Veggies filling:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 diced potatoes</li>
        <li>diced carrots</li>
        <li>diced onions</li>
        <li>minced garlic</li>
        <li>green beans</li>
        <li>ground black pepper</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Curtido (pickled cabbage)</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 a small cabbage, washed and chopped in large pieces</li>
        <li>2 large carrots, washed, peeled and chopped in large pieces</li>
        <li>1/2 small onion, chopped</li>
        <li>apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>warm water</li>
        <li>oregano, salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <h5>Filling:</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>1. Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add garlic, onion and raw carrot, stirring for about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Season ground beef with oregano, salt, pepper and achiote and then add it to the pot, stirring occasionally until brown.</li>
        <li>Drain the grease once the beef is cooked, and then return to heat. Add in potatoes (and green beans if using.) Stir to combine and remove from heat. Season with a few shakes of Worcestershire sauce and additional salt to taste. Set aside and allow to cool.</li>
    </ol>
        <h5>Dough (masa):</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the corn masa flour in a shallow bowl. Mix in the water, chicken bouillon, ground annatto, and salt. Knead by hand for about 5 minutes until the dough is moist and fluffy. If needed, add more water 1 tablespoon at a time. Divide the dough into 12 equal small balls. The dough can be prepared the day before, if covered and refrigerated</li>
            <li>With wet hands, press and pat each ball between your palms and flatten into thin dough rounds that are about 3 inches in diameter. Place the flattened rounds on top of plastic wrap, waxed paper, or a damp kitchen towel to prevent them from sticking to any solid surface.</li>
            <li>In the center of each dough round, place about ½ to 1 tablespoon of the Ground beef and Vegetable filling, then fold the dough over the fillings into a crescent. Seal the edges with your fingertips or the tines of a fork.</li>
            <li>In a medium saucepan heat the oil over a medium to high flame until very hot or 360ºF if using a frying thermometer. Fry the empanadas until golden brown. Serve with a side of Pickled Cabbage and Carrots and House Tomato Sauce.</li>
    </ol>
    <h5>Curtido (pickled cabbage)</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>In a food processor set to chop, add cabbage, carrots and onion all at once. Process just until chopped. (The texture will resemble coleslaw for this curtido.)</li>
        <li>Put cabbage mixture into a large bowl, add apple cider vinegar and a little warm water to taste. Season with oregano, salt and pepper. Serve or keep covered in the refrigerator.</li>
    </ol>
