    <h5>Creamy Chicken Marsala</h5>
    <p>
        A variation of the traditional Italian Scaloppine, this Americanized Marsala version is completely addictive. It’s no wonder it’s one of the most ordered chicken dishes in restaurants! Made with golden, crispy, pan-fried chicken, a mushroom-filled creamy Marsala wine sauce and a good kick of garlic, this Chicken Marsala recipe is next-level!

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <h5>Chicken</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 Tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 Tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 Tsp cracked black pepper</li>
        <li>2 large boneless and skinless chicken breasts, halved horizontally to make 4 fillets</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp unsalted butter, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Marsala Sauce</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Tsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>8 ounces brown or Cremini mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>4-5 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>3/4 cup dry Marsala wine</li>
        <li>1 1/4 low sodium chicken broth (or stock)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 tsp fresh chopped parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the flour, salt, garlic powder and pepper in a shallow bowl. Dredge the chicken in the flour mixture and shake off excess.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil and 2 tablespoons butter in a 12-inch pan or skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Fry 2 of the chicken breasts until golden-brown on both sides (about 3 to 4 minutes per side). Transfer to warm plate, tent with foil and keep warm.Repeat the same with the remaining 2 chicken breasts.</li>
        <li>In the same pan with remaining pan grease leftover from the chicken, melt 1 tablespoon of butter. Add the mushrooms and for 2-3 minutes until browned, scraping away at any of the leftover chicken bits off the bottom of the pan.
        </li>
        <li>Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pour in the Marsala and the broth and simmer until reduced by half and starting to thicken, (about 10-15 minutes).</li>
        <li>Pour in the cream and return the chicken back into the sauce. Cook until the sauce thickens (about 3 minutes). Garnish with chopped parsley and serve immediately. (The sauce will continue to thicken off the heat.)</li>
        <li>Serve over cooked angel hair pasta (or pasta of choice), rice, potatoes, cauliflower rice or zucchini noodles, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
